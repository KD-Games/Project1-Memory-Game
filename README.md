## Game Rules
- At each round you start with a set timer and a set score.
- To win the game you can't run out of time and your score cannot go below 0.
- If the selected cards are not a match, your score is reduced by 5 points. 
- The remaining score and remaining time carry over to the next level.
- In the Adults Level you may see a button that will flip the cards face up, you can click on the button if you're stuck, but that will reduce your score by 2 points.
